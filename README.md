### 🌟 About Me:

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Artificial Intelligence. I absolutely *love* building scalable and user-centric applications that make a real impact. Whether it's crafting a seamless online travel booking experience for the aviation industry or developing a carbon credit marketplace, I'm all about turning innovative ideas into robust solutions.

My tech playground includes:
* **Frontend Magic:** Next.js, React Js, React Native, Expo, Tailwindcss
* **Backend Power:** Supabase, Postgresql, MongoDB, Node Js, Express Js
* **Other Cool Tools:** Langchain Js, Git/Github, Docker, Github Copilot

I'm also a big believer in the power of community and collaboration! You'll often find me:
* Organizing awesome tech events like Supabase Launch Week (13 & 14)
* Contributing to open-source projects (proudly part of GSSOC'24, SSoC'3, TSOC'2!)
* Sharing knowledge at sessions like Open Source Contribution Session At RTMNU
